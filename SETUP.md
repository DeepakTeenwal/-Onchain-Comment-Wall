# üöÄ Complete Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the Onchain Comment Wall from scratch.

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
- [ ] Some testnet tokens (we'll get these for free)

## Step 1: Get API Keys

### WalletConnect Project ID (Required)

1. Go to [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Click "Create New Project"
4. Name it "Onchain Comment Wall"
5. Copy the **Project ID**

### Neynar API Key (Optional - for Farcaster integration)

1. Go to [neynar.com](https://neynar.com)
2. Sign up with your Farcaster account
3. Create a new app
4. Copy the **Client ID**

## Step 2: Get Testnet Tokens

### Celo Alfajores (Testnet)

1. Go to [faucet.celo.org](https://faucet.celo.org)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Click "Get Alfajores CELO"
4. Wait ~30 seconds

### Arbitrum Sepolia (Testnet)

1. Go to [faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Complete captcha
4. Get testnet ETH

## Step 3: Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onchain-comment-wall.git
cd onchain-comment-wall

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Step 4: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# Get this from your wallet (NEVER share this!)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x

# RPC URLs (these free ones work fine)
CELO_RPC_URL=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc

# From WalletConnect dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# From Neynar (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=your_neynar_id_here

# Leave empty for now (we'll fill after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CELO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBITRUM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=

# For local development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### üîê Getting Your Private Key (MetaMask)

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the three dots ‚Üí Account Details
3. Click "Show Private Key"
4. Enter your password
5. Copy the key (remove the `0x` prefix)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:**
- Never commit this file to GitHub
- Never share your private key
- Only use testnet wallets for development

## Step 5: Compile Contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

You should see:
```
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully
```

## Step 6: Deploy to Testnets

### Deploy to Celo Alfajores

```bash
npm run deploy:celo -- --network celoTestnet
```

You'll see output like:
```
üöÄ Deploying CommentWall to celoTestnet...
‚úÖ CommentWall deployed to: 0x1234...5678
```

**Copy the contract address!**

### Deploy to Arbitrum Sepolia

```bash
npm run deploy:arbitrum -- --network arbitrumSepolia
```

Copy this address too!

## Step 7: Update Contract Addresses

Edit `.env.local` and add your deployed addresses:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CELO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234...5678
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBITRUM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xabcd...efgh
```

## Step 8: Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should see the app! üéâ

## Step 9: Test It Out

1. Click "Connect Wallet"
2. Choose your wallet and connect
3. Switch to Celo Alfajores network in your wallet
4. Type a test message
5. Click "Post Onchain"
6. Confirm the transaction (should cost ~$0.001)
7. Wait a few seconds
8. Your message appears on the wall!

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" error
- Make sure you have testnet tokens
- Check you're on the correct network (Celo Alfajores or Arbitrum Sepolia)

### Contract not deployed
- Check your `.env.local` has the correct contract addresses
- Make sure deployment was successful

### Wallet not connecting
- Check your WalletConnect Project ID is correct
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure your wallet is unlocked

### Transaction failing
- Make sure you have enough testnet tokens for gas
- Check you're on the correct network
- Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask settings

## Next Steps

### Deploy to Mainnet (Production)

Once everything works on testnet:

1. Get real tokens (Celo and ETH for Arbitrum)
2. Deploy to mainnet:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:celo -- --network celo
   npm run deploy:arbitrum -- --network arbitrum
   ```
3. Update contract addresses in production environment variables
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Add all environment variables from `.env.local`
5. Click Deploy!
